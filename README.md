# CHT-DHIS2 Workflows

Demo OpenFn worklows to showcase CHT - DHIS2 interoperability.

_Note that commits to `main` will be auto-deployed to OpenFn app if the Github
Sync is enabled. Always work on a branch!_

## Getting started with the Repo

1. create `/tmp` folder locally with a `state.json` file that you don't commit
   to github
2. start writing and testing jobs locally with the relevant adaptor

See the
[OpenFn CLI docs](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/cli-walkthrough#7-running-workflows)
for more on writing, running, and testing workflows locally. See the
[Platform Docs](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/build/steps/step-editor)
for how to run and test workflows on the app.
